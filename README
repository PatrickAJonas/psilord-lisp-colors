psilord-lisp-colors.el

   My redaction of Peter Keller's enchanced lisp mode coloring for emacs.
   Save it in the load-path and enable with (require 'psilord-lisp-colors).

   Without modifications it will only work with dark themes.

   I've lightened the color of brackets for it to work on non-black
   dark backgrounds.

pastels-theme.el

   My dark theme for emacs based on pastels theme in Konsole.
   To use, save it in the load-path and customize-variable
   custom-enabled-themes, adding pastels.  (Color-theme package is not needed.)
